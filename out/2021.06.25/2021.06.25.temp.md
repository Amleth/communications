To build arbitrary set of MEI elements:

1. each and every MEI elements should be made addressable (xml:id => IRI) ;

3. And: sets should be composite (in the sense of the Composite DP).


## QUESTIONS

1. Do we agree to ban blank nodes?
2. Should all the MEI data & relations be converted to RDF? Is a generic asemantic tree structure built on generic properties (like "parent contains children") "enough"? Or do we need a more "musical" model to represent the underlying structure of the score? See [RDFizing the score](https://github.com/Amleth/source-sherlockizer-service#-rdfizing-the-score) as an exemple of a dumb 1:1 mapping MEI/RDF.

# [2] MODELLING THE TIME M(I/A)CRO STRUCTURE

## OBSERVATIONS

Extracting & making note offsets & score offsets addressable reveals a musical reality that is not present in the MEI encoding. Music cannot be simply reduced to its notation.

# [2] MODELLING THE TIME M(I/A)CRO STRUCTURE

## OBSERVATIONS

Extracting & making note offsets & score offsets addressable reveals a musical reality that is not present in the MEI encoding. Music cannot be simply reduced to its notation.


## QUESTIONS

- Are the temporal data extracted with [Music21](https://github.com/Amleth/source-sherlockizer-service#-prerequisite-2-implications--decisions) enough to cover all offset-related analytical needs?
- What a more complex model would enable us to do?
- Should the "traditionnal" annotation "Anchor/Relation/Target/Creator/Context" model be modified to support our analytical goals? Perhaps towards a greater explicitness of the analytical project?

# INTRODUCTION: TONALITIES <span style="font-weight: 100">(reminder)</span>

TONALITIES analytical goals imply two functionnal prerequisites:

•••

- 🎶 The possibility to address arbitrary sets of MEI elements that do not necessarily follow the logical organization of the MEI XML file structure. _For example: groupings of notes which forms a relevant observable on the musicological level but that are disjointed in the MEI XML structure._

•••

- 🥁 The possibility to address "verticalities" (musical offsets expressed in rhythmic values defined at note or score level), for example to annotate the score with root notes that have been identified by the analysts. These verticalities are not materialized in the MEI encoding.

How to model, make addressable and annotate stuff that do not exist at the document level?

# ANNOTATION? • QUESTIONS

- An annotation my be seen as the conjunction of:
  •••

  - ‹A set of unambiguous fragments taken from one or several potentially heterogeneous sources (the _anchor_).›
    •••
  - A third party resource that may introduce new knowledge (the _target_).
    •••
  - The meaning of the relation between the anchor and the target.
    •••
  - An actor who undertakes a more or less explicit interpretative project.
    •••
  - The circumstances in which it was carried out (temporal, historical, geographical, etc.).
    •••

<br/>

- I have already presented some engineering gizmos (a MEI preprocessor, a dumb MEI2RDF converter, a FastAPI service…):
<div style="text-align: center">`https://github.com/Amleth/source-sherlockizer-service`</div>
- Today, I only come with modelling questions.

# [1] MODELING THE SCORE?

## OBSERVATIONS

To build arbitrary set of MEI elements:

1. each and every MEI elements should be made addressable (xml:id => IRI) ;
   •••
2. the structure of the MEI document should be exposed in some way.
   •••
3. And: sets should be composite (in the sense of the Composite DP).

•••

## QUESTIONS

1. Do we agree to ban blank nodes?
   •••
2. Should all the MEI data & relations be converted to RDF? Is a generic asemantic tree structure built on generic properties (like "parent contains children") "enough"? Or do we need a more "musical" model to represent the underlying structure of the score? See [RDFizing the score](https://github.com/Amleth/source-sherlockizer-service#-rdfizing-the-score) as an exemple of a dumb 1:1 mapping MEI/RDF.
   •••
3. Same question for user sets.

# [2] MODELLING THE TIME M(I/A)CRO STRUCTURE

## OBSERVATIONS

Extracting & making note offsets & score offsets addressable reveals a musical reality that is not present in the MEI encoding. Music cannot be simply reduced to its notation.

•••

## QUESTIONS

- Are the temporal data extracted with [Music21](https://github.com/Amleth/source-sherlockizer-service#-prerequisite-2-implications--decisions) enough to cover all offset-related analytical needs?
- What a more complex model would enable us to do?
- Should the "traditionnal" annotation "Anchor/Relation/Target/Creator/Context" model be modified to support our analytical goals? Perhaps towards a greater explicitness of the analytical project?
